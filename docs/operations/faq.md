# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about S4.

## General Questions

### What is S4?

S4 (Super Simple Storage Service) is a lightweight, self-contained S3-compatible storage solution with a web-based management UI. It combines Ceph RGW with SQLite backend and a Node.js/React web interface for managing S3 buckets and objects.

### What is S4 used for?

S4 is designed for:

- **Development and testing** - Local S3-compatible storage for development
- **POCs and demos** - Quick S3 storage for demonstrations
- **Simple deployments** - Lightweight alternative to full-scale object storage
- **Model storage** - Storing ML models and datasets
- **File transfers** - Moving files between S3 and local storage

### Is S4 production-ready?

S4 is production-ready for single-instance deployments with some limitations:

- ✅ Security hardening complete
- ✅ Type safety and error handling
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ⚠️ Single admin user (no RBAC)
- ⚠️ In-memory rate limiting (resets on restart)
- ⚠️ Ephemeral configuration (not persisted)

See [Production Readiness Guide](../deployment/production-readiness.md) for details.

### What S3 operations does S4 support?

S4 supports core S3 operations:

- **Buckets**: Create, list, delete
- **Objects**: Upload, download, list, delete
- **Folders**: Create, navigate (prefix-based)
- **Transfers**: Copy between S3 and local storage
- **HuggingFace**: Import models directly from HuggingFace

### Does S4 replace MinIO or Ceph?

No. S4 is a lightweight solution for specific use cases. For production object storage with features like versioning, lifecycle policies, replication, and multi-tenancy, use MinIO or full Ceph deployment.

## Deployment Questions

### How do I deploy S4?

Three deployment options:

1. **Container** (Docker/Podman) - See [Docker Deployment](../deployment/docker.md)
2. **Kubernetes** - See [Kubernetes Deployment](../deployment/kubernetes.md)
3. **OpenShift** - See [OpenShift Deployment](../deployment/openshift.md)

Quick start:

```bash
podman run -d --name s4 -p 5000:5000 -p 7480:7480 \
  -v s4-data:/var/lib/ceph/radosgw \
  quay.io/rh-aiservices-bu/s4:latest
```

### What ports does S4 use?

- **5000** - Web UI (HTTP)
- **7480** - S3 API (HTTP)

### Do I need to configure S3 credentials?

Default credentials are provided:

- **Access Key**: `s4admin`
- **Secret Key**: `s4secret`

For production, set custom credentials:

```bash
-e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key \
-e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
```

### Can I use external S3 instead of internal RGW?

Yes! Set the S3 endpoint to point to external S3:

```bash
-e AWS_S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.amazonaws.com \
-e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-key \
-e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret
```

S4 will use the external S3 service instead of internal RGW.

### How do I enable authentication?

Set both `UI_USERNAME` and `UI_PASSWORD`:

```bash
-e UI_USERNAME=admin \
-e UI_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
```

When both are set, JWT authentication is required.

## Configuration Questions

### How do I change the maximum file upload size?

Set `MAX_FILE_SIZE_GB` environment variable:

```bash
-e MAX_FILE_SIZE_GB=50
```

Default is 20GB.

### Can I configure multiple local storage paths?

Yes! Provide comma-separated paths:

```bash
-e LOCAL_STORAGE_PATHS=/data/models,/data/datasets,/data/artifacts
```

### How do I configure proxy settings?

Set HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY:

```bash
-e HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080 \
-e HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080 \
-e NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

### How long do JWT tokens last?

Default: 8 hours. Configure with:

```bash
-e JWT_EXPIRATION_HOURS=4
```

### Where is data stored?

Two persistent volumes:

1. **S3 Data**: `/var/lib/ceph/radosgw` - S3 bucket metadata and objects
2. **Local Storage**: `/opt/app-root/src/data` - Local filesystem storage

## Operational Questions

### How do I view logs?

**Container**:

```bash
podman logs s4 -f
```

**Kubernetes**:

```bash
kubectl logs -l app=s4 -f
```

### How do I backup S4 data?

**Container** (named volumes):

```bash
podman stop s4
podman run --rm -v s4-data:/source -v $(pwd):/backup \
  alpine tar czf /backup/s4-backup.tar.gz -C /source .
podman start s4
```

**Kubernetes** (Velero):

```bash
velero backup create s4-backup --include-namespaces s4
```

### How do I upgrade S4?

**Container**:

```bash
podman pull quay.io/rh-aiservices-bu/s4:latest
podman stop s4
podman rm s4
podman run -d --name s4 ... quay.io/rh-aiservices-bu/s4:latest
```

**Kubernetes**:

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/s4 s4=quay.io/rh-aiservices-bu/s4:v1.1.0
kubectl rollout status deployment/s4
```

### Can I run multiple replicas?

S4 is designed for single-replica deployment:

- **Single replica**: Fully supported (recommended)
- **Multiple replicas**: Not recommended. Would require:
  - Shared JWT_SECRET
  - External S3 or ReadWriteMany storage

For single-replica deployment, JWT secret can be set for consistency across restarts:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: s4-credentials
stringData:
  JWT_SECRET: 'shared-secret-for-all-replicas'
```

### How do I reset the admin password?

**Container**:

```bash
podman stop s4
podman rm s4
podman run -d --name s4 -e UI_PASSWORD=new-password ...
```

**Kubernetes**:

```bash
kubectl delete secret s4-credentials
kubectl create secret generic s4-credentials \
  --from-literal=UI_USERNAME=admin \
  --from-literal=UI_PASSWORD=new-password
kubectl rollout restart deployment/s4
```

## Feature Questions

### Does S4 support S3 versioning?

No. S4 uses Ceph RGW with SQLite backend which doesn't support S3 versioning.

### Does S4 support S3 lifecycle policies?

No. Lifecycle policies are not supported.

### Can I use S4 with multiple users?

No. S4 currently supports a single admin user. Multi-user support and RBAC are planned for future releases.

### Does S4 support bucket policies?

No. S4 doesn't support S3 bucket policies.

### Can I import private HuggingFace models?

Yes! Set your HuggingFace token:

```bash
-e HF_TOKEN=hf_your_token
```

Then use the HuggingFace import feature in the UI.

### Does S4 support encryption?

- **At rest**: Use encrypted storage class (Kubernetes) or encrypted volumes (container)
- **In transit**: Deploy behind HTTPS reverse proxy/ingress
- **S3 SSE**: Not currently supported

## Troubleshooting Questions

### S4 container won't start

Check:

1. Ports not already in use: `lsof -i :5000`
2. Sufficient resources: 2GB RAM minimum
3. Volume permissions (rootless podman)
4. Container logs: `podman logs s4`

See [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.md) for details.

### Cannot log in

Check:

1. Authentication is enabled: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/auth/info`
2. Credentials are correct
3. JWT_SECRET is set (multi-replica)
4. Browser is not blocking cookies

### Buckets not loading

Check:

1. S3 endpoint is reachable: `curl http://localhost:7480/`
2. S3 credentials are correct
3. RGW is running: `podman exec s4 ps aux | grep radosgw`
4. Backend logs: `kubectl logs <s4-pod>`

### Upload fails

Check:

1. File size within limit (MAX_FILE_SIZE_GB)
2. Disk space available
3. Network timeout settings
4. Backend logs for errors

## Performance Questions

### How many objects can S4 handle?

S4 uses SQLite backend which works well for:

- **Buckets**: Hundreds
- **Objects**: Thousands to tens of thousands per bucket

For millions of objects, use full Ceph or MinIO deployment.

### What is the maximum file size?

Default: 20GB (configurable via `MAX_FILE_SIZE_GB`)

Theoretical maximum: Limited by available disk space and memory.

### How many concurrent transfers are supported?

Default: 2 concurrent transfers (configurable via `MAX_CONCURRENT_TRANSFERS`)

Increase based on available resources:

```bash
-e MAX_CONCURRENT_TRANSFERS=5
```

### Can I improve S4 performance?

Yes:

1. **Use SSD storage** for PVCs
2. **Increase CPU/memory limits**
3. **Reduce concurrent transfers** if memory-limited
4. **Use external S3** for better scalability

## Security Questions
