# S4 - Super Simple Storage Service

S4 is a lightweight, self-contained S3-compatible storage solution with a web-based management interface.

Perfect for POCs, development environments, demos, and simple deployments where a full-scale object storage solution is overkill.

It combines Ceph RADOS Gateway (RGW) backed by a standard filesystem and a modern UI into a single, easy-to-deploy container.

S4 provides full S3 API compatibility while requiring minimal resources and configuration.

## Quick Start (local)

```bash
# Run S4 with persistent storage
podman run -d \
  --name s4 \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -p 7480:7480 \
  -v s4-data:/var/lib/ceph/radosgw \
  quay.io/rh-aiservices-bu/s4:latest

# Access the web UI
open http://localhost:5000

# Use S3 API with default credentials
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=s4admin
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=s4secret
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:7480
aws s3 mb s3://my-bucket
```

## Quick Start (OpenShift/Kubernetes)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/s4.git
cd s4

# Install with Helm
helm install s4 ./charts/s4 --namespace s4 --create-namespace

# Access the web UI (OpenShift - route is created automatically)
oc get route s4 -n s4 -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'

# Access the web UI (Kubernetes - port forward)
kubectl port-forward svc/s4 5000:5000 -n s4
# Then open http://localhost:5000
```

For advanced configuration options (authentication, storage sizing, ingress, etc.), see the [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment/).
